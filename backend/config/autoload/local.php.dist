 * Copy this file without the ".dist" suffix and populate values as needed.
 *
 * READ THIS CAREFULLY:
 *
 * - The ".dist" file is part of the Git repository. DO NOT EDIT IT.
 * - The file you'll copy (sans the ".dist" suffix) is by default ignored
 *   by Git via .gitignore. This is a good practice as it prevents sensitive
 *   credentials from being accidentally commited to the repository.
